Today I find myself wondering "What am I doing?" I decided to ask Bob what about how he found his purpose in life, "Hey Bob! How did..." "I find my pupose in life?" Bob interjected. "Yeah! that's right!" Bob answered, "It just came to me one day, when I was taking a shower." I thought, "That's dumb!" then I left.
